Mandelmlf
By Stephen Sviatko

A multi-threaded fractal generator that demonstrates the following:

- Calling 64-bit assembly language from C++
- Linking assembly language programs with C/C++ code
- AVX (modern version of SSE) vector instructions and their use
- Simple usage of X Windows: create and draw in a window

Requirements:

- X11 development library (libx11-dev on a Debian system)
- NASM

How to use:

Pass width and height arguments (optionally) to change window size.
Left-click to recenter image.
Scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

If you zoomed in somewhere and the calculation gets intensive, be patient.
Smaller window sizes == faster speed.
