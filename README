Mandelmlf
By Stephen Sviatko

A multi-threaded fractal generator that demonstrates the following:

- Calling 64-bit assembly language from C++
- Linking assembly language programs with C/C++ code
- AVX (modern version of SSE) vector instructions and their use
- Simple usage of X Windows: create and draw in a window

The fractal generation algorithm is implemented entirely in amd64
assembly language. It computes the escape values for a Mandelbrot
set 8 points at a time, using the AVX vector extensions that allow
a 256 bit block of 8 conventional IEEE float values at a time.

Meanwhile, the image is divided up into sectors based on the number
of hardware threads your system supports, and this activity is
parrallelized up to the limits of your hardware concurrency.

Requirements:

- X11 development library (libx11-dev on a Debian system)
- NASM (sudo apt-get install nasm)

How to use:

Pass width and height arguments (optionally) to change window size.
Left-click to recenter image.
Scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

If you zoomed in somewhere and the calculation gets intensive, be patient.
Smaller window sizes == faster speed.
